# Beginner-Finance-Projects
These are all small projects I've worked on to gain real world Python experience. Focuses around equities' data, cryptocurrencies, markets,
trading and economics.
Some of these files build off of each other, some don't. I'm new to Github so I'll do it this way until I learn otherwise.
