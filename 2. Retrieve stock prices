## sets starting and end dates for data we pull
import datetime as dt

##lets us use charts, graphs, things like that
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import style

import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web
style.use ('ggplot')

## put in date range of data you want here
start = dt.datetime(2000,1,1)
end = dt.datetime(2018,12,31)

## df stands for datafram which is pretty much a spreadsheet, put in stock ticker where "TSLA" is
df = web.DataReader('TSLA','yahoo', start, end)

## df.head by default prints first five rows in dataframe, I've put 6 to make it the first 6 rows
print (df.head(6))

## df.tail would show last 6 rows
